### Option: `timer_repeat_count`

Number of times to repeat `timer_finished_wav` (default is 3).

### Option: `timer_repeat_delay`

Delay before repeating `timer_finished_wav`, in seconds (default is 0.75).

### Option: `noise_suppression`

Noise suppression level (0 is disabled, 4 is max). Disabled by default.

### Option: `auto_gain`

Automatic volume boost for microphone (0 is disabled, 31 dbfs is max). Disabled by default.

### Option: `mic_volume_multiplier`

Multiply microphone volume by fixed value (1.0 = no change, 2.0 = twice as loud). 1.0 is the default.

### Option: `sound_enabled`

Enables or disables output audio.

### Option: `sound_volume_multiplier`

Multiply sound output volume by fixed value (1.0 = no change, 2.0 = twice as loud). 1.0 is the default.

### Option: `synthesize_using_webhook`

When text-to-speech text is returned send it to a webhook. This feature does nothing entirely on its own. You will need to create an automation using the webhook platform trigger. Read the HA webhook automation trigger [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger) for more information.

<summary>Example Automation</summary>

```yaml
alias: Satellite response
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: webhook
    allowed_methods:
      - POST
      - PUT
    local_only: true
    webhook_id: "synthesize-assist-microphone-response"
condition: []
action:
  - service: telegram_bot.send_message
    metadata: {}
    data:
      message: "{{ trigger.json.response }}"
      title: Smarto
  - service: tts.cloud_say
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.name
      cache: false
      message: "{{ trigger.json.response }}"
mode: single
```
</details>

If you're doing this, you probably aslo want to set `sound_enabled` to false.

### Option: `webhook_id`

### Option: `synthesize_script`

The script that does the heavy lifting of sending the text you want to synthesize to the home assistant webhook. This is only relevant if `synthesize_using_webhook` is true.

### Option: `debug_logging`
